Chrome/Chromium extension. Clicking the extension icon shows the external
referrer of newly created tabs. Useful for people who tend to forget why
they've opened certain tabs (= everyone).

I've hacked this together for my own purposes, without thinking a lot.
This is my first Chrome extension. Use at your own risk. Getting more
stable now, though.
