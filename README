Chrome/Chromium extension. Shows the referrer of the current
page whenever the extension icon is clicked.  Useful if you
can no longer remember why you've opened a certain tab.

I've hacked this together for my own purposes, without
thinking a lot. This is my first Chrome extension. Use at
your own risk. Getting more stable now, though.
