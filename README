Chrome/Chromium extension. Shows the referrer of the current
page whenever the extension icon is clicked.  Useful if you
can no longer remember why you've opened a certain tab.

Warning: Bugs do exist. I've just hacked this together for my
own purposes, without thinking a lot. This is my first Chrome
extension. Use at your own risk.
