# Chrome Tab Demystifier
## A Chrom(e|ium) extension for tab hoarders
### What does it do?

For newly created tabs that have an external referrer, an icon is shown in the address bar. Hovering over this icon shows the referrer. Clicking on the icon opens a pop-up which displays the title of the referrer and the last access time.

This extension is useful for people who tend to forget why or when they have opened certain tabs (= everyone).

### Installation

Quick and dirty:

1. Go to _Tools -> Extensions_
2. Enable _Developer mode_
3. Click _Load unpacked extension..._
4. Select folder ..

Or [build a proper package](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/packaging.html).
